### Early life[[edit](https://www.halopedia.org/Veta_Lopis?action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Early life")]

Veta Lopis was born on [Gao](https://www.halopedia.org/Gao "Gao") at some point between [2520](https://www.halopedia.org/2520 "2520") and [2521](https://www.halopedia.org/2521 "2521").[\[1]](https://www.halopedia.org/Veta_Lopis#cite_note-VetaAge-1)[\[2]](https://www.halopedia.org/Veta_Lopis#cite_note-Ethirties-2) When she was seventeen years old, she was kidnapped and endured abuse in a small stone cellar for three weeks. She eventually escaped by breaking out and killing her captor with a rock, only to learn that her father had died of grief while she was gone.[\[8]](https://www.halopedia.org/Veta_Lopis#cite_note-8) This traumatic experience instilled in her the desire to see injustice of any kind met with strict retribution and so she enrolled at the [Avelos Academy](https://www.halopedia.org/Avelos_Academy "Avelos Academy") to study criminal investigation and become a homicide investigator.[\[9]](https://www.halopedia.org/Veta_Lopis#cite_note-9) Since the age of 20,[\[10]](https://www.halopedia.org/Veta_Lopis#cite_note-10) Lopis took down multiple hardened killers, and had become Gao's top homicide investigator by her early 30s.[\[7]](https://www.halopedia.org/Veta_Lopis#cite_note-ant-7) Many of her childhood attitudes towards the UNSC were formed by the yearlong ordeal of the [Blockade of Gao](https://www.halopedia.org/Blockade_of_Gao "Blockade of Gao").[\[11]](https://www.halopedia.org/Veta_Lopis#cite_note-11)

Veta's mother died around [2551](https://www.halopedia.org/2551 "2551").[\[12]](https://www.halopedia.org/Veta_Lopis#cite_note-12) Her closest surviving family included two aunts and six cousins, all of whom lived on Gao, as of [2553](https://www.halopedia.org/2553 "2553").[\[13]](https://www.halopedia.org/Veta_Lopis#cite_note-13)

### Crisis on Gao[[edit](https://www.halopedia.org/Veta_Lopis?action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Crisis on Gao")]

* *Main article: [Operation: JOVIAN WHISTLE](https://www.halopedia.org/Operation:_JOVIAN_WHISTLE "Operation: JOVIAN WHISTLE")*

In [May 2553](https://www.halopedia.org/2553#May "2553"), the UNSC's [717th Xeno-Materials Exploitation Battalion](https://www.halopedia.org/717th_Xeno-Materials_Exploitation_Battalion "717th Xeno-Materials Exploitation Battalion") arrived on Gao in search of a [Forerunner](https://www.halopedia.org/Forerunner "Forerunner") [ancilla](https://www.halopedia.org/Ancilla "Ancilla") in the [Montero Cave System](https://www.halopedia.org/Montero_Cave_System "Montero Cave System"); however, the UNSC did not reveal their mission's goal to the Gaos, much to the fiercely independence-minded colonials' chagrin. The situation escalated when the ancilla, [Intrepid Eye](https://www.halopedia.org/Intrepid_Eye "Intrepid Eye"), began covertly murdering Gao citizens in the Montero Cave System in order to create discord between Gao's citizens and the UNSC. With many Gaos already accusing the UNSC for the murders, the [Gao Ministry of Protection](https://www.halopedia.org/Gao_Ministry_of_Protection "Gao Ministry of Protection") dispatched Lopis and her team to find the killer on [July 2, 2553](https://www.halopedia.org/2553#July "2553"). In addition to her investigation, she was to covertly glean information on the UNSC's classified activities on Gao and report her findings to her superior, [Minister of Protection](https://www.halopedia.org/Minister_of_Protection?action=edit&redlink=1 "Minister of Protection (page does not exist)") [Arlo Casille](https://www.halopedia.org/Arlo_Casille "Arlo Casille").[\[5]](https://www.halopedia.org/Veta_Lopis#cite_note-hll-5)

Lopis could not carry out her investigation entirely unhindered, with [Major](https://www.halopedia.org/Major "Major") [Ira Halal](https://www.halopedia.org/Ira_Halal "Ira Halal") of the [UNSC Judge Advocate General's Corps](https://www.halopedia.org/UNSC_Judge_Advocate_General%27s_Corps "UNSC Judge Advocate General's Corps") intent on ensuring she did not incriminate the UNSC unfairly and [Lieutenant](https://www.halopedia.org/Lieutenant "Lieutenant") [Frederic-104](https://www.halopedia.org/Frederic-104 "Frederic-104") of [Spartan](https://www.halopedia.org/Spartan "Spartan") [Blue Team](https://www.halopedia.org/Blue_Team "Blue Team") reluctant to reveal classified information, despite the battalion's [commanding officer](https://www.halopedia.org/Commanding_officer "Commanding officer"), [Commander](https://www.halopedia.org/Commander "Commander") [Murtag Nelson](https://www.halopedia.org/Murtag_Nelson "Murtag Nelson"), ordering the Spartan to cooperate with her. Due to the brutal nature of the killings—which would have required enormous brute strength—as well as Fred's secretive behavior and Lopis' ingrained dislike and distrust of the Spartans, she initially believed the murderer to be one of the supersoldiers.[\[5]](https://www.halopedia.org/Veta_Lopis#cite_note-hll-5)
